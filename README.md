### Background:

The conformational plasticity of protein loops plays a critical role in molecular recognition, allosteric control,
ligand binding, and signaling. However, structural
variability of protein loops presents a challenge for X-ray crystallography, which is normally limited to static
structural models. As a consequence, mobile loops are often absent from crystallographic structures deposited in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB). To rebuild the missing loops, we have used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations additionally
guided by the experimental diffraction data.

**Goal:** The main goal of this project is to reconstruct the protein loop ensemble using Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulation guided by the experimental diffraction data.

### Methods:

- A number of protein structures with missing loop regions have been identified by the automated parsing of
  the [RCSB database](https://www.rcsb.org/).
- Initial loop conformations were generated using Modeller program.
- MD-based refinement procedure has been performed using AMBER platform on structural models in a form of crystal unit
  cells or supercells.
- The refined models involving multiple loop conformations have been validated against the available electron density
  maps using phenix.molprobity module.

### Single structure loop building: example of `1k33`

1. Download a PDB file (coordinates), CIF file (structure factors) and FASTA file (aminoacid sequence) from
   the [RCSB database](https://www.rcsb.org/). Place files into corresponding folders in `2_rcsb_data` dir.

2. Go to `2_rcsb_data/mtz` dir and convert CIF to MTZ using Phenix. Then expand it to P1 space group:

```bash
cd 2_rcsb_data/mtz
phenix.cif_as_mtz ../cif/1k33-sf.cif --ignore_bad_sigmas --merge --output_file_name=1k33-sf.mtz
phenix.reflection_file_converter --expand_to_p1 1k33-sf.mtz --write_mtz_amplitudes --mtz_root_label="FOBS" --label="FOBS" --generate_r_free_flags --non_anomalous --mtz 1k33.mtz
```

3. Build initial loop using Modeller. Please, adjust the `pdb_ids` variable in the `run_phenix.sh` accordingly before
   running it.

```bash
cd ../..
python utils/modeller/model.py
```

4. Create topology (and coordinate) file from PDB:

    * Copy pdn and P1-MTZ files into input dir:
    ```bash
   python utils/prepare_inputs/1_copy_inputs.py
    ```

    * `source` AMBER, since we rely on its Python libraries.

    * Set up Python virtual environment and install dependencies (to avoid potential conflicts, use `amber.python`):
   ```bash
   amber.python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

    * Add the repo's directory into `PYTHONPATH` variable
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
   ```

    * Run the script to prepare a model
   ```bash
   python utils/prepare_inputs/2_prepare-structures.py
   ```
   The results will be written to `4_protocol_run/amber-topology/1k33/`.

4. Prepare the refinement job:

```bash
python init.py
```

First, as a preparatory step for the x-ray restrained MD run, one needs to convert MTZ into a simple text format (
described in the AMBER manual). File conversion is performed by `write_sf_dat_file()` method of `init.py`. Second, one
needs to create x-ray-specific topology file. The expansion of the topology file (adding crystallographic parameters) is
performed by `prepare_xray_prmtop()` method of `init.py`. The files are written to `4_protocol_run/output/1k33/`. Note
that the
script automatically reads the number of residues from the topology file and uses it during the
refinement (`heating`, `evolution` and `cooling` stages).

If you wish to employ a 2x2x2 supercell model instead of the unit cell model, please, open the file `init.py` and
add `.sc` postfix to the name of the folder in the `main()` function (i.e. replace `prepared` with `prepared.sc`).

5. Finally, run the refinement job locally by executing:

```bash
python run_locally.py
```

Alternatively, if you want to use a different machine, you should employ `LocalSlurmWorker` remote runner and
execute `python run_remotely.py` instead. NB: Don't forget to adjust paths that are `source`d and `export`ed (in
essence, environmental variables should be defined similar to step 3). The results will be written
to `4_protocol_run/output/1k33`.

6. Water picking, B-factors refinement and MolProbity reports generation

Historically, these tasks were executed separately from the AMBER-based pipeline. The related files can be found in
the `4_protocol_run/phenix_refinment` directory. Please, adjust the paths in the `run_phenix_remotely.py` accordingly
before running it (change `{your_path_to_repo}` with your actually path).

If you want to run locally without slurm then launch `residue_renamer.py` on your pdb, adjust the paths in
the `phenix.sh` and launch it. The first argument of the script should be the path to the PDB file, the second one - the
path to the MTZ file.
